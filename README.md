# My **Bankings** App

Welcome to my Banking App project! This is a web application that helps you manage your bank accounts. Here's what you can do with it:

## Features

- **Login**: Use your account details to log in. Here are some sample accounts for testing:
  - Account 1: User: mb , PIN: 1111
  - Account 2: User: at , PIN: 2222
- **Account Info**: Check your account balance, last login time, and local time.
- **Transactions**: Keep track of your financial activities, including transfers, loans, and deletions.
- **Financial Summary**: See your total deposits, withdrawals, and earned interest.
- **Sort Transactions**: Organize your transactions from largest deposit to largest withdrawal.
- **Auto-Logout**: For security, you'll be logged out after 5 minutes of inactivity.

I've built this app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a little more detail on what's included:
